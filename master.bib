  abstract	= {This article examines how and why French Jews began to
		  speak of themselves as a "race." Though we often assume
		  that Jewish racial identity was an invention of
		  anti-Semites in the 1880s, Jewish publicists had in fact
		  adopted this language as early as the 1820s. Far from
		  unwittingly appropriating the language of their detractors,
		  Jews borrowed the language of race from scholars neutral or
		  sympathetic to their cause in ways that made sense in light
		  of their larger strategies of self-defense. The scholars
		  who pioneered modern race theory were not the late
		  nineteenth-century Social Darwinists; they were romantic
		  historians like the Thierrys and Michelet, who saw France
		  as a nation composed of a plurality of peoples who had come
		  together over time to form a unified nation. Race thus
		  provided a framework for understanding difference as
		  legitimate, useful and dignified at a moment when
		  anti-Jewish publicists attacked Jews as anti-social and
		  immoral people who brought only harm to France. Looking at
		  what French Jews borrowed from these early historians
		  allows us to see the interconnections between Jewish
		  self-defense and Jewish self-definition. In seeking to
		  guarantee their rights and social status, French Jews
		  appropriated new terms of understanding who they were.},

  abstract	= {The publication of Ernest Renan's La Vie de Jésus in 1863
		  is rightly regarded as a key moment in French history. The
		  book served as an important symbol of science and free
		  thought in the battles over the Republic and laïcité, and
		  presented a thesis that characterized French scientific
		  philosophy in the mid-nineteenth century. Jesus, for Renan,
		  transcended his own culture, rejecting all social
		  constraints in the pursuit of a unique ideal of the kingdom
		  of God, becoming in the process the first true
		  individualist in history. Critics ridiculed his arguments,
		  but it was typical of the Romanticism of the French
		  positivists. Renan's philosophy was rooted not in
		  empiricism, but in an essentially pantheistic metaphysics,
		  prizing the realization of God within oneself as the
		  highest ethical achievement. This was an innovation of the
		  highest importance in France, where a traditionalist, but
		  post-Christian theism had marked social thought since the
		  Revolution. Renan and his generation, notably Taine,
		  dispensed with the traditionalist religious dualism that
		  typified the social outlook of Tocqueville, Michelet, and
		  their contemporaries. Far from articulating a materialist
		  dead end in the history of ideas, their Romantic
		  individualism was critical to later developments in
		  European thought, including aestheticism and
		  irrationalism.},
